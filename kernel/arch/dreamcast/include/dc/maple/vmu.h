    This file provides an API around the various Maple function
    types (LCD, MEMCARD, CLOCK) provided by the Visual Memory Unit. 
    Each API can also be used independently for devices which aren't
    VMUs, such as using MEMCARD functionality with a standard memory

    The Sega Dreamcast's Visual Memory Unit (VMU) 
    is an 8-Bit gaming device which, when plugged into 
    the controller, communicates with the Dreamcast 
    as a Maple peripheral.

    As a Maple peripheral, the VMU implements the 
    following functions:
    - <b>MEMCARD</b>: Storage device used for saving and 
                      loading game files.
    - <b>LCD</b>:     Secondary LCD display on which additional
                      information may be presented to the player.
    - <b>CLOCK</b>:   A device which maintains the current date 
                      and time, provides at least one buzzer for
                      playing tones, and also has buttons used 
                      for input.

    Each Maple function has a corresponding set of C functions
    providing a high-level API around its functionality.

    <i>really</i> know what you're doing, as you can easily corrupt
    the filesystem by writing incorrect data. Instead, you should
    favor the high-level filesystem API found in vmufs.h, or just

    To stop an active tone, one can simply generate a flat wave, such as by 
    submitting both values as 0s.

    \warning
    Any submitted waveform which has a duty cycle of greater than or equal to 
    its period will result in an invalid waveform being generated and is 
    going to mute or end the tone.

    \note
    Note that there are no units given for the waveform, so any 3rd party VMU 
    is free to use any base clock rate, potentially resulting in different 
    frequencies (or tones) being generated for the same parameters on different 
    devices.

    \note
    On the VMU-side, this tone is generated using the VMU's Timer1 peripheral
    as a pulse generator, which is then fed into its piezoelectric buzzer. The 
    calculated range of the standard VMU, given its 6MHz CF clock running with a 
    divisor of 6 is driving the Timer1 counter, is approximately 3.9KHz-500Khz;
    however, due to physical characteristics of the buzzer, not every frequency
    can be produced at a decent volume, so it's recommended that you test your
    values, using the KOS example found at `/examples/dreamcast/vmu/beep`.
