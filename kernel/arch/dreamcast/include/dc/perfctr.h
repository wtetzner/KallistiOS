/** \defgroup perf_counters_timer Timer
    \brief    High-resolution performance counter-based timer API

    This API allows for using the performance counters as high-resolution
    general-purpose interval timer with 5ns ticks. It does this by configuring
    \ref PRFC0 in \ref PMCR_ELAPSED_TIME_MODE.

    \note
    This is enabled by default. To use \ref PRFC0 for something else, either
    use perf_cntr_timer_disable() or perf_cntr_start() to reconfigure it for
    something else. When disabled, the timer will simply fall through to use
    timer_ns_gettime64() from the timer driver, decreasing the resolution of
    each tick to 80ns.

    \warning
    The performance counter timer is only counting \a active CPU cycles. This
    means that when KOS's thread scheduler uses the "sleep" instruction, 
    putting the CPU to sleep, these counters cease to record elapsed time. 
    Because of this, they should only be used to measure small deltas that
    are not across frames, when you want real wall time rather than active
    CPU time.

    application, not the actual wall-time or monotonic clock, as it ceases
    to count when the kernel puts the CPU to sleep.
