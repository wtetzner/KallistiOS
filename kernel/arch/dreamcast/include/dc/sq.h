/** \defgroup  store_queues Store Queues
    \brief  SH4 CPU Peripheral for burst memory transactions.

    The store queues are a way to do efficient burst transfers from the CPU to
    external memory. They can be used in a variety of ways, such as to transfer
    a texture to PVR memory. The transfers are in units of 32-bytes, and the
    destinations must be 32-byte aligned.

    \note
    Mastery over knowing when and how to utilize the store queues is 
    important when trying to push the limits of the Dreamcast, specifically
    when transferring chunks of data between regions of memory. It is often
    the case that the DMA is faster for transactions which are consistently 
    large; however, the store queues tend to have better performance and 
    have less configuration overhead when bursting smaller chunks of data.
