# GCC custom dependencies
# Specify here if you want to use custom GMP, MPFR and MPC libraries when
# building GCC. It is recommended that you leave this variable commented, in
# which case these dependencies will be automatically downloaded by using the
# '/contrib/download_prerequisites' shell script provided within the GCC packages.
# The ISL dependency isn't mandatory; if desired, you may comment the version
# numbers (i.e. 'sh_isl_ver' and 'arm_isl_ver') to disable the ISL library.
