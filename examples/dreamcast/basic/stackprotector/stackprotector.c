/* This example shows how to make use of GCC's -fstack-protector options to
   enable stack-smashing protection in your code. You must add a
   -fstack-protector option to your KOS_CFLAGS in your Makefile to make use
   of this functionality (this example uses -fstack-protector-all).

   This example also shows how to override the default stack protector
   failure handler to customize it (we add the PR address to the output to
   help narrow down where the error occurred.

   Keep in mind that optimizations may shift things around, so for best
   results you should be using the stack protector with optimizations
   disabled. Here, we manually disable inlining on the function that trips
   the stack protector to ensure that it trips in the correct function.

   Thanks to mrneo240 for the idea of printing out the PR in the handler and
   for giving me the impetus to actually add the ability to override the
   handler to the Newlib patch.
