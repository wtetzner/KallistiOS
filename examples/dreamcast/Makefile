# ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
# This script recursively checks each directory to determine if it should 
# execute its Makefile based on the presence of Makefiles in its subdirectories.
#
# Steps:
# 1. For each directory, identify all direct subdirectories.
# 2. Check each subdirectory for the existence of a Makefile.
# 3. If any subdirectory contains a Makefile, recursively perform this check on 
#    that subdirectory and do not execute the Makefile in the current directory.
# 4. If no subdirectories contain a Makefile, execute the Makefile in the 
#    current directory.
#
# Purpose:
# - This approach ensures that Makefiles are only executed in the most specific 
#   (deepest) directories that do not contain further subdirectories with 
#   Makefiles.
# - This prevents redundant builds in parent directories and ensures errors are
#   logged with specific directory paths, providing clear visibility into which 
#   particular build process failed without aggregating errors at a higher 
#   directory level.
